            "The global shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) presents a unique opportunity for Somalia. As infrastructure develops, the potential for clean, quiet, and efficient transportation grows. Early challenges include establishing a reliable charging network and educating the public on the benefits of electric mobility, but the long-term advantages are undeniable.",
            "For a car rental business like YOURCAR, being an early adopter of electric vehicles could be a significant market differentiator. Offering EV rentals would appeal to environmentally conscious tourists, NGOs, and business travelers. Furthermore, the lower running costs of EVs, due to cheaper 'fuel' (electricity) and reduced maintenance needs, can lead to better profit margins and more competitive rental prices."

            "Driving in a vibrant and bustling city like Mogadishu is an experience in itself. To ensure your journey is safe and enjoyable, it's important to stay alert and be aware of your surroundings. Traffic can be dynamic, with a mix of cars, motorcycles, and pedestrians. The key is to drive defensively, maintain a safe following distance, and always be prepared for the unexpected.",
            "Always use your turn signals to indicate your intentions, and make use of your horn with short, polite taps to alert other drivers of your presence, especially when navigating tight intersections or busy roundabouts. Most importantly, drive with confidence but not aggression, and always show courtesy to other road users. Planning your route ahead of time can also help minimize stress and allow you to focus on the road."

            "The perfect rental car depends entirely on your itinerary. Are you on a business trip, primarily staying within the city? A compact sedan like the Hyundai Accent is economical, easy to park, and perfect for navigating city streets. Its fuel efficiency makes it a smart choice for budget-conscious travelers.",
            "However, if you're traveling with a group, have lots of luggage, or plan to explore areas with more challenging roads, a Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) is the superior choice. An SUV offers more space, a higher driving position for better visibility, and often better handling on diverse terrain. By matching the vehicle to your needs, you ensure a comfortable and stress-free rental experience."
